Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing
teams who take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds
when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a
ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat.
The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the
ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases,
having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to
score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive
team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming
runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A
run is scored when a runner legally advances around the
bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the
player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs
by the end of the game is the winner.
The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely. A player on the batting team who
reaches first base without being called "out" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either
immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or
runners "out", which forces them out of the field of play. Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the
batting team's players out. The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting
team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an
inning. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of
the game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no
game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.
Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This
game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th
century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is popular in North
America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South
Korea and Taiwan.
In the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National
League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The MLB champion
is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan
between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League. The World
Baseball Classic, organized by the World Baseball Softball Confederation, is the major international competition
of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world.
Rules and gameplay
A baseball game is played between two teams, each composed of nine players, that take turns playing offense
(batting and baserunning) and defense (pitching and fielding). A pair of turns, one at bat and one in the field, by
each team constitutes an inning. A game consists of nine innings (seven innings at the high school level and in
doubleheaders in college and minor leagues, and six innings at the Little League level). One team—customarily
the visiting team—bats in the top, or first half, of every inning. The other team—customarily the home team—bats
in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The goal of the game is to score more points (runs) than the other
team. The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by touching all four bases, in order, set at the corners
of the square-shaped baseball diamond. A player bats at home plate and must attempt to safely reach a base
before proceeding, counterclockwise, from first base, to second base, third base, and back home to score a run.
The team in the field attempts to prevent runs from scoring by recording outs, which remove opposing players
from offensive action, until their next turn at bat comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch
roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, extra innings are played to resolve
the contest. Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players andinnings.
The game is played on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-
degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 270-degree area
outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the
infield; the area farther beyond the infield is the outfield. In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound,
with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically
demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height. The fair territory between home plate
and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as
well.
There are three basic tools of baseball: the ball, the bat, and the glove or mitt:
The baseball is about the size of an adult's fist, around 9 inches (23 centimeters) in circumference. It has a
rubber or cork center, wound in yarn and covered in white cowhide, with red stitching.
The bat is a hitting tool, traditionally made of a single, solid piece of wood. Other materials are now
commonly used for nonprofessional games. It is a hard round stick, about 2.5 inches (6.4 centimeters) in
diameter at the hitting end, tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in a knob. Bats used by adults
are typically around 34 inches (86 centimeters) long, and not longer than 42 inches (106 centimeters).
The glove or mitt is a fielding tool, made of padded leather with webbing between the fingers. As an aid in
catching and holding onto the ball, it takes various shapes to meet the specific needs of different fielding
positions.
Protective helmets are also standard equipment for all batters.
At the beginning of each half-inning, the nine players of the fielding team arrange themselves around the field.
One of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitcher's mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on
the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another fielding team player, the
catcher, squats on the far side of home plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the fielding team faces home plate,
typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines
(basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. In the standard arrangement, there is a
first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a
shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base. The basic outfield positions
are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in
fair territory when the pitch is delivered. A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher. Other umpires will be
distributed around the field as well.
Play starts with a member of the batting team, the batter, standing in either of the two batter's boxes next to
home plate, holding a bat. The batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and
attempts to hit the ball with the bat. The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit—as a result of either
electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher. A batter who hits the ball into the field
of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a runner
(or, until the play is over, a batter-runner). A batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out is said to
be safe and is on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base
or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely. A player who reaches base despite
proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a
single. If a player makes it to second base safely as a direct result of a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple. If the
ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or otherwise
safely circles all the bases, it is a home run: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases,
each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. A player who reaches base due to a fielding
mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an error.
Any runners already on base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair
territory, before or after the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a
ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the
base they occupied when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied
out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up (contact the base they occupied when
the play began, as or after the ball is caught). Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the
pitcher is in the process of delivering the ball to home plate; a successful effort is a stolen base.A pitch that is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are
recorded strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free
advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a
pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to
determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone,
a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down
to the hollow of the knee.
While the team at bat is trying to score runs, the team in the field is attempting to record outs. In addition to the
strikeout, common ways a member of the batting team may be put out include the flyout, ground out, force out,
and tag out. It is possible to record two outs in the course of the same play. This is called a double play. Three
outs in one play, a triple play, is possible, though rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to
their team's dugout or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another
player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins
with the bases empty.
An individual player's turn batting or plate appearance is complete when the player reaches base, hits a home
run, makes an out, or hits a ball that results in the team's third out, even if it is recorded against a teammate. On
rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded
against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A
batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes
recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate
appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate
appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their
turn at bat in the batting order. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except
for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game.
Children's games often have more lenient rules, such as Little League rules, which allow players to be
substituted back into the same game.
If the designated hitter (DH) rule is in effect, each team has a tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat (and
run). The DH takes the place of another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not
field. Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of
nine players.
Personnel
Players
The number of players on a baseball roster, or squad, varies by league and by the level of organized play. A
Major League Baseball (MLB) team has a roster of 25 players with specific roles. A typical roster features the
following players:
Eight position players: the catcher, four infielders, and three outfielders—all of whom play on a regular
basis
Five starting pitchers who constitute the team's pitching rotation or starting rotation
Six relief pitchers, including one closer, who constitute the team's bullpen (named for the off-field area
where pitchers warm up)
One backup, or substitute, catcher
Two backup infielders
Two backup outfielders
One pinch hitter, or a utility player, or a seventh reliever
Most baseball leagues worldwide have the DH rule, including MLB's American League, Japan's Pacific League,
and Caribbean professional leagues, along with major American amateur organizations. The Central League in
Japan and the National League do not have the rule, and high-level minor league clubs connected to National
League teams are not required to field a DH. In leagues that apply the designated hitter rule, a typical team has
nine offensive regulars (including the DH), five starting pitchers, seven or eight relievers, a backup catcher, and
two or three other reserve players.
OtherThe manager, or head coach, oversees the team's major strategic decisions, such as establishing the starting
rotation, setting the lineup, or batting order, before each game, and making substitutions during games—in
particular, bringing in relief pitchers. Managers are typically assisted by two or more coaches; they may have
specialized responsibilities, such as working with players on hitting, fielding, pitching, or strength and
conditioning. At most levels of organized play, two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat: the
first base coach and third base coach, whom occupy designated coaches' boxes, just outside the foul lines.
These coaches assist in the direction of baserunners, when the ball is in play, and relay tactical signals from the
manager to batters and runners, during pauses in play. In contrast to many other team sports, baseball
managers and coaches generally wear their team's uniforms; coaches must be in uniform to be allowed on the
field to confer with players during a game.
Any baseball game involves one or more umpires, who make rulings on the outcome of each play. At a minimum,
one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view of the strike zone, and call balls and strikes.
Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as
attempted force outs and tag outs. In MLB, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the
playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.
Strategy and tactics
Many of the pre-game and in-game strategic decisions in baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general,
right-handed batters tend to be more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, lefthanded batters tend to be more successful against right-handed pitchers. A manager with several left-handed
batters in the regular lineup, who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher, may respond by
starting one or more of the right-handed backups on the team's roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief
pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create
favorable matchups with their substitutions. The manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed
pitcher-batter matchups and the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With
a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one
whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder (known as a defensive substitution).
Pitching and fielding tactics
The tactical decision that precedes almost every play in a baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and
then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the
baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter; thus creating differing pitches that can
be selected. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball,
the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different
repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the
pitcher what type of pitch to throw, as well as its general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is
disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch.
With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the
base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to
rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of
these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, which permits any runners on base to
advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a
ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base.
Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit to one side of the field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with
most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the
infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground
ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.
Batting and baserunning tactics
Several basic offensive tactics come into play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of
whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed, with a skillful contact hitter,
the runner takes off with the pitch, drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating a gap
in the infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt, calls for the batter to focus on making soft
contact with the ball, so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoringposition as the batter is thrown out at first. A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to
bunt for a hit. A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is
known as a squeeze play. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on
hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a
successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. In order to increase the chance of advancing a batter
to first base via a walk, the manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls
than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch. The batter's potential reward of reaching base (via a walk)
exceeds the disadvantage if the next pitch is a strike.
History
The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. Consensus once held
that today's baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular among children in
Great Britain and Ireland. Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (2005), by American
baseball historian David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical
evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of
each other, and that the game's most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and "tut-ball". The
earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John
Newbery. Block discovered that the first recorded game of "Bass-Ball" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured
the Prince of Wales as a player. This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English
immigrants.
By the early 1830s, there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable as early forms
of baseball being played around North America. The first officially recorded baseball game on this continent was
played in Beachville, Ontario, Canada, on June 4, 1838. In 1845, Alexander Cartwright, a member of New York
City's Knickerbocker Club, led the codification of the so-called Knickerbocker Rules, which in turn were based on
rules developed in 1837 by William R. Wheaton of the Gotham Club. While there are reports that the New York
Knickerbockers played games in 1845, the contest long recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game
in U.S. history took place on June 19, 1846, in Hoboken, New Jersey: the "New York Nine" defeated the
Knickerbockers, 23–1, in four innings. With the Knickerbocker code as the basis, the rules of modern baseball
continued to evolve over the next half-century.
In the United States
Establishment of professional leagues
In the mid-1850s, a baseball craze hit the New York metropolitan area, and by 1856, local journals were referring
to baseball as the "national pastime" or "national game". A year later, the sport's first governing body, the
National Association of Base Ball Players, was formed. In 1867, it barred participation by African Americans. The
more formally structured National League was founded in 1876. Professional Negro leagues formed, but quickly
folded. In 1887, softball, under the name of indoor baseball or indoor-outdoor, was invented as a winter version
of the parent game. The National League's first successful counterpart, the American League, which evolved
from the minor Western League, was established in 1893, and virtually all of the modern baseball rules were in
place by then.
The National Agreement of 1903 formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between them
and the National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's minor
professional leagues. The World Series, pitting the two major league champions against each other, was
inaugurated that fall. The Black Sox Scandal of the 1919 World Series led to the formation of a new National
Commission of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together. The first major league baseball
commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was elected in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the Negro
National League; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was
joined by the Eastern Colored League.
Rise of Ruth and racial integration
Compared with the present, professional baseball in the early 20th century was lower-scoring, and pitchers were
more dominant. The so-called dead-ball era ended in the early 1920s with several changes in rule and
circumstance that were advantageous to hitters. Strict new regulations governed the ball's size, shape and
composition, along with a new rule officially banning the spitball and other pitches that depended on the ballbeing treated or roughed-up with foreign substances, resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit. The rise of
the legendary player Babe Ruth, the first great power hitter of the new era, helped permanently alter the nature of
the game. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, St. Louis Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey invested in
several minor league clubs and developed the first modern farm system. A new Negro National League was
organized in 1933; four years later, it was joined by the Negro American League. The first elections to the
National Baseball Hall of Fame took place in 1936. In 1939, Little League Baseball was founded in Pennsylvania.
A large number of minor league teams disbanded when World War II led to a player shortage. Chicago Cubs
owner Philip K. Wrigley led the formation of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League to help keep the
game in the public eye. The first crack in the unwritten agreement barring blacks from white-controlled
professional ball occurred in 1945: Jackie Robinson was signed by the National League's Brooklyn Dodgers and
began playing for their minor league team in Montreal. In 1947, Robinson broke the major leagues' color barrier
when he debuted with the Dodgers. Latin American players, largely overlooked before, also started entering the
majors in greater numbers. In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born Chico Carrasquel and black
Cuban-born Minnie Miñoso, became the first Hispanic All-Stars. Integration proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six
of the 16 major league teams had a black player on the roster.
Attendance records and the age of steroids
In 1975, the union's power—and players' salaries—began to increase greatly when the reserve clause was
effectively struck down, leading to the free agency system. Significant work stoppages occurred in 1981 and
1994, the latter forcing the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in 90 years. Attendance had been
growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994, before the stoppage, the majors were setting their all-time
record for per-game attendance. After play resumed in 1995, non-division-winning wild card teams became a
permanent fixture of the post-season. Regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997 and the secondhighest attendance mark for a full season was set. In 2000, the National and American Leagues were dissolved
as legal entities. While their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter
distinction), the regulations and other functions—such as player discipline and umpire supervision—they had
administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of MLB.
In 2001, Barry Bonds established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season. There had long been
suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by the abuse of illegal steroids (as
well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion), but the issue only began attracting significant media
attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance-enhancing drugs before 2004. In 2007,
Bonds became MLB's all-time home run leader, surpassing Hank Aaron, as total major league and minor league
attendance both reached all-time highs.
Around the world
Widely known as America's pastime, baseball is well established in several other countries as well. As early as
1877, a professional league, the International Association, featured teams from both Canada and the US. While
baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the
American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National
League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League.
In 1847, American soldiers played what may have been the first baseball game in Mexico at Parque Los Berros
in Xalapa, Veracruz. The first formal baseball league outside of the United States and Canada was founded in
1878 in Cuba, which maintains a rich baseball tradition. The Dominican Republic held its first islandwide
championship tournament in 1912. Professional baseball tournaments and leagues began to form in other
countries between the world wars, including the Netherlands (formed in 1922), Australia (1934), Japan (1936),
Mexico (1937), and Puerto Rico (1938). The Japanese major leagues have long been considered the highest
quality professional circuits outside of the United States.
After World War II, professional leagues were founded in many Latin American countries, most prominently
Venezuela (1946) and the Dominican Republic (1955). Since the early 1970s, the annual Caribbean Series has
matched the championship clubs from the four leading Latin American winter leagues: the Dominican
Professional Baseball League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League, and
Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. In Asia, South Korea (1982), Taiwan (1990) and China (2003) all
have professional leagues.The English football club, Aston Villa, were the first British baseball champions winning the 1890 National League
of Baseball of Great Britain. The 2020 National Champions were the London Mets. Other European countries
have seen professional leagues; the most successful, other than the Dutch league, is the Italian league, founded
in 1948. In 2004, Australia won a surprise silver medal at the Olympic Games. The Confédération Européene de
Baseball (European Baseball Confederation), founded in 1953, organizes a number of competitions between
clubs from different countries. Other competitions between national teams, such as the Baseball World Cup and
the Olympic baseball tournament, were administered by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) from its
formation in 1938 until its 2013 merger with the International Softball Federation to create the current joint
governing body for both sports, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC). Women's baseball is played
on an organized amateur basis in numerous countries.
After being admitted to the Olympics as a medal sport beginning with the 1992 Games, baseball was dropped
from the 2012 Summer Olympic Games at the 2005 International Olympic Committee meeting. It remained part
of the 2008 Games. While the sport's lack of a following in much of the world was a factor, more important was
MLB's reluctance to allow its players to participate during the major league season. MLB initiated the World
Baseball Classic, scheduled to precede its season, partly as a replacement, high-profile international
tournament. The inaugural Classic, held in March 2006, was the first tournament involving national teams to
feature a significant number of MLB participants. The Baseball World Cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition
in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic.
Distinctive elements
Baseball has certain attributes that set it apart from the other popular team sports in the countries where it has a
following. All of these sports use a clock, play is less individual, and the variation between playing fields is not as
substantial or important. The comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's
distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.
No clock to kill
In clock-limited sports, games often end with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than competing
aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock, thus a team cannot win without
getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the
most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy. Whereas, in the case of multi-day Test and
first-class cricket, the possibility of a draw (which occurs because of the restrictions on time, which like in
baseball, originally did not exist) often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind, to bat defensively
and run out the clock, giving up any faint chance at a win, to avoid an overall loss.
While nine innings has been the standard since the beginning of professional baseball, the duration of the
average major league game has increased steadily through the years. At the turn of the 20th century, games
typically took an hour and a half to play. In the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually
ballooned to 2:38 in 1960. By 1997, the average American League game lasted 2:57 (National League games
were about 10 minutes shorter—pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters). In 2004,
Major League Baseball declared that its goal was an average game of 2:45. By 2014, though, the average MLB
game took over three hours to complete. The lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between halfinnings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play with
pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters stepping out of the box more frequently. Other
leagues have experienced similar issues. In 2008, Nippon Professional Baseball took steps aimed at shortening
games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade's average of 3:18.
In 2016, the average nine-inning playoff game in Major League baseball was 3 hours and 35 minutes. This was
up 10 minutes from 2015 and 21 minutes from 2014.
